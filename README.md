# SPM-IUB (Group 4)
Here we store the codes/reports for the SPMS software done by me and 5 other members from IUB.

SPMS is a web-based application which is written in PHP. The main purpose of our application is to monitor the performances of students and also there are graphs that will visually represent the progress of the students and faculties.
